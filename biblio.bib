	abstract = {The ternary mixture of uranium, oxygen and zirconium is investigated as a minimal model for corium, the mixture that forms after the meltdown of a nuclear reactor. Like corium, U-O-Zr exhibits a liquid–liquid phase separation between a metal-rich and an oxide-rich phase at high temperatures. A {CALPHAD} database built on an associate model is used to set up a ternary Cahn–Hilliard model, which can describe two-phase patterns in U-O-Zr. The interface structure and properties, which depend on the choice on the gradient energy coefficients in the free-energy functional, are studied in detail. It is found that interface adsorption is generally present due to the diffuse character of the interface, but that its magnitude is small, such that the model remains a robust and useful tool for future simulations of corium pool stratification dynamics.},

These models have been applied successfully to situations in which the physical phenomena of interest have a length scale commensurate with the thickness of the interfacial region (e.g. near-critical interfacial phenomena or small-scale flows such as those occurring near contact lines) and fluid flows involving large interface deformations and/or topological changes (e.g. breakup and coalescence events associated with fluid jets, droplets, and large-deformation waves). We discuss the issues involved in formulating diffuse-interface models for single-component and binary fluids. Recent applications and computations using these models are discussed in each case. Further, we address issues including sharp-interface analyses that relate these models to the classical free-boundary problem, computational approaches to describe interfacial phenomena, and models of fully miscible fluids.},

	abstract = {In-Vessel Retention ({IVR}), which arrests relocated molten core materials in the vessel during severe accident, is an appealing accident management approach to many newly-designed reactors. It is implemented in {CAP}1400 because it’s highly compatible with {CAP}1400 design philosophy. Extensive studies of relevant phenomena are carried out to investigate the possible eﬀect on {IVR} strategy, which include core melting and relocation, in-vessel steam explosion, corium material interaction, heat ﬂux to {RPV} (Reactor Pressure Vessel) wall under the assumption of diﬀerent corium pool conﬁguration, ex-vessel {CHF} (Critical Heat Flux) test, {RPV} structural analysis and so on. For those that may have negative impact on {IVR} success, the corresponding design improvements are conducted to aid and facilitate the employment of {IVR}, such as lowering core support plate, increasing the mass of core internals, optimizing ex-vessel insulator and so on. The beneﬁt of taking decay heat from in to vessel cooling is also achieved by reﬂooding breaks or injecting {RCS} (Reactor Coolant System) under the instructions of {SAMG} (Severe Accident Mitigation Guideline). All the {IVR}-related phenomena and operator actions are reﬂected and linked together by {IVR} decomposition event tree ({DET}) to evaluate {CAP}1400 {IVR} strategy in a comprehensive manner. There is reasonable assurance that the {IVR} strategy implemented in {CAP}1400 is successful. About 93\% of core damage sequences can be terminated by retaining corium in the vessel.},

Thanks to the diffuse-interface approach, it allows us to study the evolution of arbitrary complex grain morphologies without any presumption on their shape or mutual distribution. It is also straightforward to account for different thermodynamic driving forces for microstructure evolution, such as bulk and interfacial energy, elastic energy and electric or magnetic energy, and the effect of different transport processes, such as mass diffusion, heat conduction and convection. The purpose of the paper is to give an introduction to the phase-ﬁeld modeling technique. The concept of diffuse interfaces, the phase-ﬁeld variables, the thermodynamic driving force for microstructure evolution and the kinetic phase-ﬁeld equations are introduced. Furthermore, common techniques for parameter determination and numerical solution of the equations are discussed. To show the variety in phase-ﬁeld models, different model formulations are exploited, depending on which is most common or most illustrative.},

The solver is capturing the interface between two immiscible phases with a color function volume of fluid ({CF}-{VOF}) method. The two fluids (vapor and liquid) are assumed Newtonian and incompressible. The surface tension is modeled with continuous surface force ({CSF}) which is improved with a Lafaurie filter to suppress the spurious current. The mass flux across the interface in the phase change process is determined by either Lee or Tanasawa mass transfer models. Additionally, the slight variation of saturation temperature with local pressure is considered with the simplified Clausius–Clapeyron relation. The coupled velocity pressure equation is solved using the {PIMPLE} algorithm. The new solver is validated and examined with (i) Stefan problem, (ii) two-dimensional film boiling, (iii) the film condensation on a horizontal plate, (iv) the laminar film condensation over a vertical plate, and (v) bubble condensation in subcooled boiling. The present study shows the capability of a diffuse interface method in accurate simulation of the phase change process and it is expected to be instructive for further numerical studies in this area.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Semivolatile organic and inorganic aerosol species partition between the gas and aerosol particle phases to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium. Liquid-liquid phase separation into an organic-rich and an aqueous electrolyte phase can occur in the aerosol as a result of the salting-out effect. Such liquid-liquid equilibria ({LLE}) affect the gas/particle partitioning of the different semivolatile compounds and might significantly alter both particle mass and composition as compared to a one-phase particle. We present a new liquid-liquid equilibrium and gas/particle partitioning model, using as a basis the group-contribution model {AIOMFAC} (Zuend et al., 2008). This model allows the reliable computation of the liquid-liquid coexistence curve (binodal), corresponding tie-lines, the limit of stability/metastability (spinodal), and further thermodynamic properties of multicomponent systems. Calculations for ternary and multicomponent alcohol/polyol-water-salt mixtures suggest that {LLE} are a prevalent feature of organic-inorganic aerosol systems. A six-component polyol-water-ammonium sulphate system is used to simulate effects of relative humidity ({RH}) and the presence of liquid-liquid phase separation on the gas/particle partitioning. {RH}, salt concentration, and hydrophilicity (water-solubility) are identified as key features in defining the region of a miscibility gap and govern the extent to which compound partitioning is affected by changes in {RH}. The model predicts that liquid-liquid phase separation can lead to either an increase or decrease in total particulate mass, depending on the overall composition of a system and the particle water content, which is related to the hydrophilicity of the different organic and inorganic compounds. Neglecting non-ideality and liquid-liquid phase separations by assuming an ideal mixture leads to an overestimation of the total particulate mass by up to 30\% for the composition and {RH} range considered in the six-component system simulation. For simplified partitioning parametrizations, we suggest a modified definition of the effective saturation concentration, Cj*, by including water and other inorganics in the absorbing phase. Such a Cj* definition reduces the {RH}-dependency of the gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organics in organic-inorganic aerosols by an order of magnitude as compared to the currently accepted definition, which considers the organic species only.},

To better understand how molecular behavior differs under such conditions (collectively described as macromolecular crowding), the crowding environment has been reproduced inside artificial cells. We have previously shown that the combination of macromolecular crowding and microscale geometries imposed by the artificial cells can alter the molecular behaviors induced by macromolecular crowding in bulk solutions. We have named the effect that makes such a difference the cell-size space effect ({CSE}). Here, we review the underlying biophysics of {CSE} for phase separation of binary polymer blends. We discuss how the cell-size space can initiate phase separation, unlike nano-sized spaces, which are known to hinder nucleation and phase separation. Additionally, we discuss how the dimensions of the artificial cell and its membrane characteristics can significantly impact phase separation dynamics and equilibrium composition. Although these findings are, of themselves, very interesting, their real significance may lie in helping to clarify the functions of the cell membrane and space size in the regulation of intracellular phase separation.},

The situation is important and relevant to deep sea oil spill scenario. The droplet contains two components, one is heavier (immiscible) than water and other is lighter (miscible). When released, with an initial mixture density (890–975 kg/m3) lower than that of surrounding water, droplet rises in the column. The mass transfer of lighter solute component into water causes the droplet density to increase and droplet sinks when the density exceeds that of water. A mass-transfer correlation accounting for the loss of the solute, based on Reynolds, Grashoff, and Schmidt numbers was developed. A two-dimensional axisymmetric Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) model accounting for species transport was developed to emulate the experimental observations.

	abstract = {Over the years we have routinely used an iterative method based on a quadratic representation derived from finite differences for solving nonlinear problems in many variables. As the method addresses one variable at a time no differentiation is required which simplifies the coding and reduces the chance of errors and makes the use of different defining equations particularly simple. Besides using the method for phase equilibria problems we have also used it for the treatment of problems in coherency, the cluster variation method and the Bragg Williams modeling with many sublattices. The success of the method depends to some degree on how the variables are chosen but the use of more variables than required to define a problem causes no problems whatsoever and can expedite the solution in some cases.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric aerosols contain mixtures of inorganic salts, acids, water, and a large variety of organic compounds. Interactions between these substances in liquid mixtures lead to discrepancies from ideal thermodynamic behaviour. By means of activity coefficients, non-ideal behaviour can be taken into account. We present here a thermodynamic model named {AIOMFAC} (Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients) that is able to calculate activity coefficients covering inorganic, organic, and organic-inorganic interactions in aqueous solutions over a wide concentration range. This model is based on the activity coefficient model {LIFAC} by Yan et al. (1999) that we modified and reparametrised to better describe atmospherically relevant conditions and mixture compositions. Focusing on atmospheric applications we considered H{\textasciicircum}+, Li{\textasciicircum}+, Na{\textasciicircum}+, K{\textasciicircum}+, {NH}{\textasciicircum}+\_4, Mg{\textasciicircum}(2+), Ca{\textasciicircum}(2+), Cl{\textasciicircum}−, Br{\textasciicircum}−, {NO}{\textasciicircum}−\_3, {HSO}{\textasciicircum}−\_4, and {SO}{\textasciicircum}(2−)\_4 as cations and anions and a wide range of alcohols/polyols composed of the functional groups {CH}\_n and {OH} as organic compounds. With {AIOMFAC}, the activities of the components within an aqueous electrolyte solution are well represented up to high ionic strength. Most notably, a semi-empirical middle-range parametrisation of direct organic-inorganic interactions in alcohol+water+salt solutions strongly improves the agreement between experimental and modelled activity coefficients. At room temperature, this novel thermodynamic model offers the possibility to compute equilibrium relative humidities, gas/particle partitioning and liquid-liquid phase separations with high accuracy. In further studies, other organic functional groups will be introduced. The model framework is not restricted to specific ions or organic compounds and is therefore also applicable for other research topics.},

Cette démarche de recherche s’inscrit dans le cadre du développement d’une modélisation « fine » du comportement d’un bain de corium basée sur une approche {CFD} (« Computational Fluid Dynamics ») de la thermo-hydraulique. Elle vise à améliorer la compréhension des phénomènes mis en jeu et construire des lois de fermetures adéquates pour des modèles macroscopiques intégraux.Pour ce faire, la méthode du champ de phase couplée avec une fonctionnelle d’énergie utilisant la méthode {CALPHAD} se révèle être un outil pertinent.Dans une première partie, nous nous sommes intéressés au système binaire U-O. Nous avons développé un modèle à interface diffuse (basé sur une équation de Cahn-Hilliard) pour décrire la diffusion dans ce système. Nous avons procédé à la mise en place du couplage entre ce modèle et une base de données thermodynamiques {CALPHAD}, ainsi qu’au paramétrage d’un tel modèle avec en particulier une procédure d’élargissement de l’interface.Ensuite, dans le cadre d’une modélisation sur le système ternaire U-O-Zr nous avons proposé une généralisation du modèle à interface diffuse par le biais d’une hypothèse d’équilibre local des mécanismes d’oxydo-réduction. Nous avons porté une attention particulière à l’analyse de ce modèle par le biais de simulations numériques 1D en nous intéressant notamment à l’état stationnaire et aux profils de composition obtenus.Finalement, nous avons montré l’application de ce modèle au système U-O-Zr-Fe. Pour cela, nous avons considéré une configuration similaire aux essais expérimentaux à « petite échelle »  relatifs à l’étude de la stratification d’un bain oxyde-métal.},

	abstract = {The spinodal represents the limit of thermodynamic stability of a homogeneous fluid. In this work, we present a robust methodology to obtain the spinodal of multicomponent fluids described even with the most sophisticated equations of state ({EoS}) available. We elaborate how information about the spinodal and its uncertainty can contribute both in the development of modern {EoS} and to estimate their uncertainty in the metastable regions. Inequality constraints are presented that can be exploited in the fitting of modern {EoS} of single-component fluids to avoid inadmissible pseudo-stable states between the vapor and liquid spinodals. We find that even cubic {EoS} violate some of these constraints. With the use of a selection of {EoS} representative of modern applications, we compare vapor and liquid spinodal curves, superheat and supersaturation limits from classic nucleation theory ({CNT}), and available experimental data for the superheat limit. Computations are performed with pure species found in natural gas, binary mixtures, as well as a multi-component natural gas mixture in order to demonstrate the scalability of the approach. We demonstrate that there are large inconsistencies in predicted spinodals from a wide range of {EoS} such as cubic {EoS}, extended corresponding state {EoS}, {SAFT} and multiparameter {EoS}. The overall standard deviation in the prediction of the spinodal temperatures were 1.4 K and 2.7 K for single- and multi-component liquid-spinodals and 6.3 K and 26.9 K for single- and multi-component vapor spinodals. The relationship between the measurable limit of superheat, or supersaturation, and the theoretical concept of the spinodal is discussed. While nucleation rates from {CNT} can deviate orders of magnitude from experiments, we find that the limit of superheat from experiments agree within 1.0 K and 2.4 K with predictions from {CNT} for single- and multi-component fluids respectively. We demonstrate that a large part of the metastable domain of the phase diagram is currently unavailable to experiments, in particular for metastable vapor. Novel techniques, experimental or with computational simulations, should be developed to characterize the thermodynamic properties in these regions, and to identify the thermodynamic states that define the spinodal.},

The models consist of a Navier-Stokes system coupled with a multi-component Cahn-Hilliard system through a phase-field dependent surface tension force, variable density and viscosity, and the advection term. The classical infinitely thin boundary of separation between two immiscible fluids is replaced by a transition region of a small but finite width, across which the composition of the mixture changes continuously. A constant level set of the phase-field is used to capture the interface between two immiscible fluids. Phase-field methods are capable of computing topological changes such as splitting and merging, and thus have been applied successfully to multi-component fluid flows involving large interface deformations. Practical applications are provided to illustrate the usefulness of using a phase-field method. Computational results of various experiments show the accuracy and effectiveness of phase-field models.},

Dans ce contexte, le manque de connaissance physique et phénoménologique et la limitation des ressources numériques, font que l'utilisation de modèles hétérogènes couplés s'avère souvent nécessaire. Pour autant, le développement des capacités de calcul permet l'utilisation plus large de modèles complexes de {CFD}. Dans ce travail, on considère plus spécifiquement la simulation des phénomènes de solidification et de fusion entre un liquide chaud (représentant le corium) qui se solidifie au contact d'un solide plus froid (par exemple la cuve). L'objectif de cette thèse est de proposer des outils numériques de suivi d'interfaces de front de fusion/solidification qui ont été intégrés dans des codes dédiés à la modélisation des accidents graves. Une première approche de couplage de modèles hétérogènes 0D/2D a été proposée avec une méthode numérique adaptée à ses aspects multidimensionnels dans la plateforme {PROCOR}. Une modélisation 3D de type {CFD} a été ensuite développée à partir d'une approche monolithique. Le code {TrioCFD} a été utilisé comme base de développement et ses méthodes numériques adaptées pour le changement de phase liquide/solide. L'ensemble de ces développements a été testé et validé sur des configurations représentatives du contexte accident grave.},

	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-02489384},
	abstract = {This Ph.D. thesis is focused on ensuring a thermodynamically consistent representation of in-vessel corium (a high temperature mixture of molten reactor core and structural materials, described as a U-O-Zr-steel system) in the coupled thermohydraulic-thermochemical models that are used for performing Severe Accident ({SA}) analysis of nuclear Light Water Reactors ({LWRs}); in particular, the In-Vessel Melt Retention ({IVMR}) Strategy. In this context, the use of a thermodynamic database obtained by the {CALPHAD} method seems relevant by providing closures and inputs to the thermohydraulic and thermochemical models respectively. These databases consist of models for Gibbs energy functions of the possible phases for a system that can be used to obtain the equilibrium thermodynamic description for the system as well as material thermodynamic properties for out-of-equilibrium conditions.Through this work, a systematic approach for ensuring extensive utilization of {CALPHAD} data in the coupled models has been developed, and the associated questions have been answered for ‘mock-up’ macroscopic and mesoscopic models developed for describing some of the phenomena pertaining to in-vessel corium behaviour.As a first step, the feasibility of using {CALPHAD} based closures (in the form of enthalpy-temperature relations and local equilibrium conditions) has been tested on the macroscopic model developed using the lumped parameter approach. Considering the ternary U-O-Zr system, this model describes the plane front solidification process at the boundary of a molten corium pool. The second part of the work is focused on the development of a general formulation for diffuse interface models under the phase-field approach, which can be used to simulate the kinetics of various thermochemical processes under non-isothermal conditions such as solidification and phase segregation. The questions related to the thermodynamic consistency of the model as well as its parameterization (in particular with respect to the up-scaling of the interface thickness) have been addressed and the numerical results have been discussed for binary U-Zr and U-O systems under isothermal conditions.},

	abstract = {During a severe accident in a nuclear reactor, the melting of the core may lead to the formation of a multiphase liquid pool (corium) in the vessel lower head. The heat transfer at the boundary with the vessel is affected by diffusive and convective mass fluxes. In particular, the development of Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities influence the thickness of the top metallic layer and therefore the “focusing effect” of the heat flux, which is the main risk for the vessel integrity. We use a Cahn–Hilliard pseudo-binary model to describe the uranium/oxygen/zirconium/ iron mixture. The diffusion and the convection are governed by the Cahn–Hilliard equation and the Navier–­ Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation. In this work, the model is isothermal and the buoyancy force is only due to the gradient of chemical composition. The model is solved in three dimensions with a pseudospectral code. The initial configuration consists of a light layer of iron-rich fluid above a heavy layer of uranium/ oxygen/zirconium mixture. A thin layer of heavier metallic phase lays at the interface and eventually triggers a Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The metallic phase forms a plume which falls downward and then breaks up into droplets due to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The phenomenon is alimented by diffusion which generates the heavy metallic phase at the interface. The droplet formation observed in an experiment of corium stratification transient from the literature is qualitatively captured. The mobility, the viscosity and the surface tension are shown to have an influence on the mass transfer.},

	abstract = {During a severe accident in a nuclear reactor, core damage occurs and may lead to the formation of corium, followed by relocation to the vessel lower head. The decay heat released by the corium can threaten the integrity of the vessel, if no effective cooling mechanism is in place. In-Vessel Retention ({IVR}) is a severe accident mitigation strategy that has been shown to work for low-to-intermediate power reactors. For high power reactors, many uncertainties still exist. In an attempt to remove some of these uncertainties, the European H2020 {IVMR} project was launched in 2015. The focus of this project is on obtaining the additional, necessary, experimental data in order to improve on current modelling strategies. One of the modelling strategies investigated is the potential use of {CFD} codes in assessing the feasibility of {IVR} for high power reactors. The main focus of the {CFD} studies is on two important aspects of {IVR}: the presence of a metallic layer on top of the corium pool and the homogenous corium pool. These aspects are analysed by studying the thermal hydraulic features of a thin metal layer and that of a homogeneous pool. In this paper, ﬁrst the used codes and numerical approaches are presented. The numerical models are subsequently assessed by comparing numerical results with relevant simulant-based experimental data, resulting, in general, in good agreement. The codes are then used to perform exploratory computations under prototypical conditions. While the behaviours of water and prototypical materials are similar for the oxide pool, signiﬁcant differences are observed for the metallic layer.},

The overall approach is based on the risk oriented accident analysis methodology ({ROAAM}) and the assessment includes consideration of bounding scenarios and sensitivity studies, as well as arbitrary parametric evaluations that allow for the delineation of the failure boundaries. The technical treatment in this assessment includes: (a) new data on energy flow from either volumetrically heated pools or non-heated layers on top, boiling and critical heat flux in inverted, curved geometries, emissivity of molten (superheated) samples of steel, and chemical reactivity proof tests; (b) a simple but accurate mathematical formulation that allows prediction of thermal loads by means of convenient hand calculations; (c) a detailed model programmed on the computer to sample input parameters over the uncertainty ranges, and to produce probability distributions of thermal loads and margins for departure from nucleate boiling at each angular position on the lower head; and (d) detailed structural evaluations that demonstrate that departure from nucleate boiling is a necessary and sufficient criterion for failure. Quantification of the input parameters is carried out for an {AP}600-1ike design, and the results of the assessment demonstrate that lower head failure is 'physically unreasonable.' Use of this conclusion for any specific application is subject to verifying the required reliability of the depressurization and cavity-flooding systems, and to showing the appropriateness (in relation to the database presented here, or by further testing as necessary) of the thermal insulation design and of the external surface properties of the lower head, including any applicable coatings. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

He uses this result to show howρ varies withh (Section 6), how this variation leads to a stable minimum free energy (Section 7), and to calculate the capillary energy or surface tensionσ (Section 9). Near the critical pointσ varies as (τk-τ)3/2, whereτkis the critical temperature (Section 11). The paper closes with short discussions of the thickness of the surface layer (Section 12), of the difficulty of assuming thatρ varies discontinuously with height (Section 14), and of the possible effect of derivatives of higher order than (d2ρ/dh2) on the free energy and surface tension (Section 15).},

A 45, 7424 (1992)], but has a different definition of the free energy density for interfacial region. An extra potential originated from the free energy density definition in the {WBM} model disappears in this model. At a dilute solution limit, the model is reduced to the Tiaden et al. model [Physica D 115, 73 (1998)] for a binary alloy. A relationship between the phase-field mobility and the interface kinetics coefficient is derived at a thin-interface limit condition under an assumption of negligible diffusivity in the solid phase. For a dilute alloy, a steady-state solution of the concentration profile across the diffuse interface is obtained as a function of the interface velocity and the resultant partition coefficient is compared with the previous solute trapping model. For one dimensional steady-state solidification, where the classical sharp-interface model is exactly soluble, we perform numerical simulations of the phase-field model: At low interface velocity, the simulated results from the thin-interface {PFM} are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. As the partition coefficient becomes close to unit at high interface velocities, whereas, the sharp-interface {PFM} yields the correct answer.},
